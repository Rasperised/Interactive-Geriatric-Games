## Hardware Integration

Hardware devices communicate with Unity using serial communication.

Sensor data includes:
- IMU tilt values
- Distance sensor readings

These values are parsed in Unity and mapped to:
- Player movement
- Object interaction
- Game control states

Exact wiring and pin assignments depend on the specific hardware setup
and are documented within the hardware folder.
