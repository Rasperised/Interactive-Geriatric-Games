All playable builds are available as downloadable ZIP files.

## Repository Structure
- `unity/` – Unity project files for all games
- `hardware/` – ESP32 / M5StickC controller code

## Notes
- Due to Unity’s folder structure, it is recommended to extract or clone this repository into a short directory path (e.g. `C:\repo\`) to avoid Windows path length issues.
