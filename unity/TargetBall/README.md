## Target Ball Game

This folder contains two variants of the Target Ball rehabilitation game, each exploring a different control method. Both of these games uses the arm movement rehabilitation device.

- **Arc Version:** Ball movement follows a curved path controlled by arm tilt input.
- **Vertical Version:** Ball movement is controlled using vertical arm displacement.

Each variant is implemented as a standalone Unity project and can be opened independently in Unity Hub.
